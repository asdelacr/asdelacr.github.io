Well, Hello there.

My name is Aylin Delacruz ( phonetic spelling: I-LEAN DE-LA-CRUISE ), and Welcome to my Website! 

I am a game lover, technology enthusiast, and secret holder of the Triforce of Wisdom (if you hadn't guessed it already, I am a pretty big Legend of Zelda fan). 

I am always looking for my next big opportunity and finding a career that explores all bound of what tech can accomplish! I enjoy meeting new people, working on teams and developing novel projects. 

But, let me start from the beginning...

My full name is Aylin Selena Delacruz. I was born April 3rd at the very early hours of Easter Sunday. I am American, though culturally, I identify as Turkish and Mexican. Weird combination, I know, but I embrace uniqueness.

I grew up right in the heart of the East Bay Area in Northern California.
At a very early age, I was introduced to science and technology through my Engineer parents.
I became fascinated with computers, the internet, printers, etc. and it slowly grew to different video games and consoles. 

At every grade level, I always aimed to be the best student and was eager for a challenge. 
I developed a love for math and a disdain for literature (to say the least). 
When it came to thinking about the future and what I wanted to do, I was often conflicted and did not know what specific title I wanted to be. Up until my Senior Year of high school, I had jumped around different career options, like a Veterinarian or Doctor... 

But at my core, I am a problem solver, and finding solutions to existing or arising issues is what I aspire to do in this life.

My hobbies include playing video games, eating good food, and traveling the world. I have been to more countries than states, and I feel most at home swimming in the calm sea.

Education: 

Ultimately, I went to UC Santa Cruz to study Computer Science: Computer Game Design. 
What had appealed to me most about my major was the balance of design and technician. 
I learned foundational technical skills like programming and computer engineering.
I studied various design techniques and team-working skills necessary to build and release a product.

And Now?

Now, I want to use my 20+ years in Education (Yes, I started Pre-school when I was 2 and a half) to utilize my knowledge, skills, and experience to be part of a society that nurtures its inhabitants and continues to build for a future in mind.
