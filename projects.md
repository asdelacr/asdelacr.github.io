<!-- this is actually the About me page-->

Well, Hello there.

My name is Aylin Delacruz ( phonetic spelling: I-LEAN DE-LA-CRUISE ), and Welcome to my Website! 

I am a game lover, technology enthusiast, and secret holder of the Triforce of Wisdom (if you hadn't guessed it already, I am a pretty big Legend of Zelda fan). 

I am always looking for my next big opportunity and finding a career that explores all bound of what tech can accomplish! I enjoy meeting new people, working on teams and developing novel projects. 

But, let me start from the beginning...
____________________________________________________________________________________________

I grew up right in the heart of the East Bay Area in Northern California.

Ultimately, I went to UC Santa Cruz...
