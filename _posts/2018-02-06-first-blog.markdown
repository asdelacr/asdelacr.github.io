Hello world! Ha, bet you haven’t heard enough of that! (if you don’t know the reference, you probably have never taken a programming class…)


But welcome to my ‘blog’ or I guess you could call it my website (that I coded from scratch if I might add!) where I write about games, game culture, game reviews, and really anything else that I am inspired to openly talk about!

I became motivated to start up this project a few months after I graduated college. I majored in Computer Science: Game Design at UC Santa Cruz because I love games, and I wanted to pursue a career in game development. Post-Graduation has not been very kind though, as I am continuously discovering how DIFFICULT it is to break into the game industry. I mean, talk about demoralizing.


But to ensure that I remain positive (a.k.a. sane) while still continuing to search for my first, full-time job, I thought this would be a nice outlet to just pour my thoughts and opinions into! 

I highly doubt most people will ever find this, but if you are one of the few, then THANK YOU! I appreciate the fact that you are taking your valuable time to read through this word vomit (or the good kind if you really enjoy it). 


All opinions are my own. 

That being said, if you disagree with something I say and feel a strong desire to reach out to me to express your stance, I would be more than happy to initialize a conversation in a respectful manner. 

But if you are just looking to attack me because I said “I feel women are underrepresented and misconstrued in the game industry”, then bye. No one likes an arrogant cabbage head.


Enjoy!
