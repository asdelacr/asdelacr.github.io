I was born in 1994, and even before the start of the 2000s, I remember holding my first game controller; it was from the Nintendo Entertainment System to be exact. Although my early childhood memories are very faint, I still recall playing games like Balloon Fight, Mario Bros, and Duck Hunt. 

And that was just the beginning. 
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Every so often I would visit my Aunt that lived nearby and watch my cousins and their friends have a blast playing Mario Party 2 on the Nintendo64. A few times, they would even let me play with them, though I was a bit intimidated by their “elderliness”, to say the least, and opted to just watch as they played. 

I received my first console when I was 8 years old, a pink Gameboy Advance. It became my favorite device of all time, not because the games were all that stellar, but for the fact that it was portable, that you could bring it ANYWHERE. I brought my Gameboy anytime I traveled abroad (and I traveled a lot for a young child), many times to show my cousins so we could all watch and play together. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Even at a young age, I knew there were problems with games, gender, and equality. 

I was constantly called a girl gamer because I was the only female I knew that openly enjoyed playing and talking about games. 

I was called a “Try-Hard”, a girl who only “liked” games to gain the boys’ attention. There were times when I randomly jumped into my peers’ conversations when they mentioned a game I was currently playing, and most times it was met with silence and awkward stares. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

In a perfect world, we would not be talking about gender parity. We would not be discussing the absence of strong female figures in the game industry. Girls would be in conversations, and boys would listen and respond appropriately. 

Of course that’s not to say that this does not happen. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It does…

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


But not enough. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


I am careless for the fact that I need my love and passion for games to be justified by anyone, regardless of sex or gender. 

I know who I am, what I am, my likes and dislikes. 

I was incredibly fortunate and grateful to have parents that understood the love I had for games even when they did not entirely comprehend it themselves. From the PS2 to GameCube to PS3 and 4, and Wii and 360, it took me years to finally realize that designing and developing games was a potential career path I needed to follow. 

It was so much more than a hobby at this point. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It was my upbringing, my sanctuary. It was where I used my magical powers to become greater, more capable than a human girl. It was where I could vanquish evil to the another dimension and be crowned a hero.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

A great diversity of games allowed me to explore worlds unimaginable to human belief.

But to be given the knowledge on how to create any type of world that I wanted…

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

To not wait on a developer to create my ideal game…

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

That was priceless. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

So we reach September of 2012, the start of my freshman year of college as a Computer Game Design major. 

I am excited but even more anxious. 

This is my first time living in a dorm with roommates, hall mates, 17 girls to a single bathroom! I am the only engineering major, no one on my floor actively plays games, but I don’t care. 
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It’s all about branching out, right? 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
During the first week, our living community held multiple networking events for us to get familiarized with one another, especially if we had similar majors. 

Now, I expected to not meet many female Game Design majors, let alone many females within the engineering department (Side note: around 2012, our department was 80% male and 20% female), so I obviously was not surprised when that realization came to be. 
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

But, no matter! Regardless of gender, we should all be able to communicate, socialize, and work together cohesively.
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

…Right?

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

One of the first conversations I had was with another freshman Game major. I introduce myself like usual, and he asks what I am majoring in. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

“Game Design,” I say casually yet proudly. 

“Oh? Do you play games?”
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I just respond with a small laugh, “Yeah, of course!” And the conversation just turns to “what classes are you taking”, blah blah blah, and dies after that. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I met a lot of people during this period, and 50% of the time, I would be asked if I played games after declaring I was a games major. 

In the moment, I really thought nothing of it, that it was just an informative question. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


Eventually, after the first year, after that question had been asked repetitively, I grew annoyed. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Being a student that liked to study in public areas on campus, I overheard many interesting conversations, especially among the engineering kids. It was during one conversation where I realized how drastic the dynamic between sexes was. 

When it was two males asking each other their majors and one happened to be Game Design, the immediate question would ALWAYS be “Cool, man, what kind of games do you play?”

Okay, cool, you assumed he plays games because he told you he was majoring in game design. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


Why wasn’t I ever asked that? 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
Oh! But I was! 

Indeed, I was asked this question after telling several people, like my roommates, hall mates, and friends I had made from my classes or tutoring sessions. 
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

They happened to be mostly female. 

A few males of course, but mostly female.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
Was it a coincidence or did they, meaning women, “understand”? 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
But it was just an innocent question, right? 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Now, did I truly believe the males that asked me this had a harmful intent to belittle me or my dream of becoming a game developer? 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
The short answer is No. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I don’t believe there was ever a harmful intent whenever I was asked if I played games. 

But there were definitely traces of ignorance. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

To ask someone if they played games after they said they were majoring in game design, is like asking a film major if they watch movies.

From my interpretation, in order to study film techniques, you would likely need to watch movies that have displayed similar methods as a reference and example. Similarly, to study the incorporation of different game mechanics for example, you need to play games of a related genre.

 Sure, there can theoretically be game designers and developers that do not play any games whatsoever…

 But, in my opinion, that would predictably make for such a potentially uncultured, terribly designed game. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Despite the ignorant underlying meaning in the question “Do you play games?”, I constantly brushed it off and continued for a normal conversation. I mean, it was not their fault they did not understand why that question was stupid and rude. To me, it was an innocent mistake. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

But I guess no one learned the lesson…
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

A valuable lesson in which Females did indeed play video games. 
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Because I was still being asked this. 

Over and over again.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

And this question plagued me for years. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

My second year I created a small-scaled game using a fairly simple game creating program. I kept meeting new people in my building and told them I was a Game major. They asked “Do you play games?” and I responded with a smile, “Yes, I do!” 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

My third year I worked on an infinite runner game that was cute, quirky, and you also learned a bit about space! I also was part of a Design Research project in which I studied middle school students and their relationship with technology and games. I also realized how learning math at that age can potentially determine whether or not students would seek a STEM career in the future. I learned about games and interactive drama by developing a role-playing game that had been well-received by our professor and class. I continued meeting new people. I told them I was a Game major. They asked “Do you play games?” I didn’t smile anymore, but I always said, “Yeah, I do.”

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

My final year I developed a full-scaled game that took six months to complete. I was finally on a large team and had my designated roles. I contributed in design and development. I breathed life and creativity into these characters. I gave them voices, gave the game sound. I oversaw the art evolving and shaped it to what style best fit our game. I became self-taught in mobile app development, building for iOS and opening a developer account for the sole purpose of publishing the game on the App Store when it was ready. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It was halfway into the year when I met up with an old friend and her new partner. I was excited because he worked in the tech industry. He was a software engineer that had experience working in mobile development, a concentration that I was considering especially after developing my mobile game. I was thrilled to be talking to someone a part of my personal friend circle that understood what a game engine was, that could define the differences between Unity and Unreal. 

When we finally met, one of the very first questions he asked was about the school I went to and what I was majoring in. 

“I’m studying Game Design,” I said proudly. 

“Oh? Do you play games?” 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


And something in me finally snapped. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


It was years of being asked such a stupid, degrading, ignorant question, over and over and over and over and over again.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I faced many tough moments during my undergraduate career, especially when it came to the more technical aspect my major called for. Learning how to program would always be one of the hardest challenges I have ever faced, and it is still something I continue to work on today. 


{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

But at this moment, I realized the greatest challenge I would ever face as a female in the Game and Tech industry is to be taken seriously. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

To be asked if I played video games, not what kind of games I played, what were my favorite games, why did I want to make games, what game company did I want to work for in the future…

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

“DO YOU PLAY GAMES?”

That question stripped me of my credibility. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}



All my hard work in college, all of my dedicated projects, all the skills and experience I gained, to my childhood of playing countless games on numerous devices and consoles, to my love of Adventure, RPG, Narrative, Platformer, Fantasy, Survival Horror genres, to my dedication of bringing peace to the Mushroom Kingdom and Hyrule, to exterminating the Umbrella and Shinra Corporations, from the Switch to Ps4 and 3 and 2 to Wii and GameCube to Gameboy to N64 to finally the NES…

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

That was not considered. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

All because you could not assume that I was capable of playing a game. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Because I am a female.
And because you could never get over a stereotype. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}



You, being the person that has asked me or any other female that had told you they were majoring in Game Design or aspired to have a career in Game Development. You, who could not comprehend the idea and assume that females play games. 

YES, FEMALES PLAY GAMES. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


But in this heated and furious moment came a beautiful realization. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

“I don’t know, what do you think?” I curtly responded. 

His face grew confused. 

“Umm, so yes? No?” he stammered. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I breathed in heavily. 

“Yes, I grew up playing games. I’ve BEEN playing games since my childhood, starting from the NES to now where I’m developing a GAME! So yeah, I play games.” 

He responded with a small, “Cool, okay…” and really didn’t ask me anymore questions. Maybe it was because my tone was harsh, but I really did not care. 

I was done. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

I spent years giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, and obviously no one had learned the lesson. 

So now it had to be me to teach the lesson. Not by a long lecture, like the length of this article but by turning the tables around. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

“Oh? Do you play games?” 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

“I don’t know, what do you think?”

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It was time that they needed to be ripped out of an ignorant mindset. They needed to realize what they were asking, how it sounded, and how it made me feel...

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

It would be a small step on the mountainous trek that is the Tech Industry.

Because the struggle will still continue. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Even with a Game Design degree, finding an entry-level position in any game company is tremendously difficult, especially for women.

Because, in my personal opinion, we are looked upon as being a risk, a liability. 

Because women are “still too new” to the industry, despite that statement being a tremendous lie. 

Because men are more “able” to pick up and learn technical concepts and software than women, because of…genetics? 

Another horrendous lie. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

A few months after graduating, I was in the process of beginning work at a start-up VR Lounge in Walnut Creek, California, where my sole training responsibilities were to learn how to set up and troubleshoot VR equipment. We were a small team of 3 women, including the manager.

VR is still fairly new to society, and even established products like the Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE still have their unstable moments. So imagine trying to troubleshoot 3rd party faulty equipment that was cheaply made overseas (likely because the owner either did not completely understand how the equipment functioned or because he was cheap). 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

The owner became so incredibly upset because of our “lack” in progress for troubleshooting this equipment that he refused to hire more woman, and there was another potential candidate for hire with game experience that he refused to even interview. Instead, he suggested that men needed to be hired because they “know” how to properly work with the equipment.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

Needless to say, I left shortly after this incident, and this is a troubling story that I will eventually make a full detailed post about, but for now, it is a common example for a woman in a man-ruled industry. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

However, with the events of the #METOO and #TimesUp Movement putting a spotlight on the misogynistic, powerful figures of Hollywood, my hope is that it will trickle its way to Tech companies and corporations alike; and the Games Industry is in a perfect position. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

My hope is that the industry will change, that women will emerge and become recognized for their accomplishments in creating innovative devices and titles. 

My hope is that finding a job in the industry will become more humane, that the competitive and cutthroat nature of barely securing an interview will be long gone. 

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

But those goals are at the top of the mountain, and we are still taking our first few steps up, and the foundation is not as stable as I would like.

{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
{% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}

 But I will go up nonetheless. 

 {% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
 {% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}
 {% include image.html url="/img/humor.jpg" description="" %}


And slap every person that asks THAT question with a dose of reality.
