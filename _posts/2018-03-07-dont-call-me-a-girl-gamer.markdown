 Hello World! Welcome to my first comprehensive post where the topic we will be discussing today is: females and games. 

For those who are unfamiliar with this topic, let me first provide some facts before we continue onward:

1.	Females (basically anyone that identifies as a female) play games. 
2.	There are Females that develop games.

And that’s basically all the initial information you need! Easy, right?


Now you may be thinking, Wow, oh my gosh. Do you really need to explain that girls game too?! This is already a stupid post…

Well, yes and no. 

No, because of course there are females that play games. As the saying goes, It’s not rocket science. There are millions of gamers out there in the world right now, so by assumption, some of them are bound to be female. 

Okay, okay, I know I am just stating the obvious, and I probably sound a bit condescending right now, but now we are at the Yes. 

Yes, I need to explain that females play games because it still surprises some people. 

I am not making this up. 


This happened to me, and many other of my female comrades. 

But before I dive deep into this matter, we first need to appropriately define gamer. And for that, we look no further than online dictionary sites!

Sidenote: Right now, I am not going to elaborate on the more specified subcategories when defining Gamer. I am aware there are different ranks that range from newbie to casual to hardcore, but I will bring that to attention fairly soon. 

(Humor me for just a bit longer.)

According to Merriam-Webster, Gamer is defined as ‘a player who is game’ or ‘a person who plays games’. 

Oxford defines Gamer as ‘a person who plays video games or participates in role-playing games’, while Wikipedia states: ‘A gamer is a person who plays interactive games, either video games, board games, skill-based card games or physical games, and plays for usually long periods of time’.

And just for fun, Urban Dictionary’s top definitions for Gamer include: ‘someone who plays video games when bored…usually very good at it’, ‘An all-inclusive term to describe the maligned, often-misunderstood group of people that regularly engage in video, computer, or tabletop games’, and my personal favorite: ‘Somebody who finds refuge from the sheer mundanity of everyday life in the bosom of a particularly engrossing videogame.’


At the core, all of these definitions have the same classification. Merriam-Webster’s second definition, a person who plays games, keeps it minimal yet accurate. Oxford and Wikipedia elaborate more on this while also including non-video games like board games (like Candyland), card games (like Uno), and RPG games (like D&D), which are often forgotten and not considered when defining a game. 

And well, Urban Dictionary, though not a completely trusted source when it comes to accurate and APPROPRIATE definitions, has some hilariously truthful ones that can resonate with anyone that calls themselves a gamer.

What is especially important about these definitions is that they do not use any gender-binding words when attached to gamers, only using neutral synonyms like someone, somebody, person, and so forth.

And rightfully so! 

Interestingly enough, the only time I came across “girl gamer” was on the Wikipedia page, just two paragraphs down from the initial description of Gamer, in which it elaborates more on the entire point I have been trying to make! 

Yes, Video Games, for a period of time, were solely marketed to males, which caused the gender parity clause. I could get into why this happened (which I will in future blog post How Japan Saved – but Tainted- the Game World), but just know that it was not always like this! 

Regardless, it reached a point where females were just the small minority of the collective Gamer group, and any female that played games were labeled as a “girl gamer” by none other than the males themselves. Because a female couldn’t just be called the normal gamer? Because she enjoyed playing games but didn’t have male genitalia? Because she was given the label “girl gamer” to represent a unique, mystified being that found enjoyment in a male dominated activity?

And Yes, while females were definitely the minority, ranging from 4 to 5% during the early 2000s, that drastically changed just a few years later!

By mid to late 2000s, the percentage of females that identified as a Gamer rose by 40%, almost making it a 50/50 split!

And yet, “girl gamer” was still being used to define them. 

They were not a minority anymore. Females were purchasing games, playing online, entering tournaments. There were more female game developers entering the market and contributing to longstanding game companies that were predominately all-male. They proved playing games was not just for men but for anyone that enjoyed spending time in such an interactive space. 


So why were they still being called “girl gamers”?

Because the damage had already been done. 



In any psychological situation, when an activity or space has been composed of the same specie for a long period of time, any being coming into the space that differs from the majority is seen as an outsider, an invader. 

Since the game space had been male-dominated for decades, when mass amounts of females finally entered the arena, they were met with discrimination, which sadly, later turned into hostility and harassment.

Now, believe me when I say I am not persecuting all males in the game space; I am only calling out those that have treated women differently than their male counterparts. 

Well, what about this: the long-existing stereotype is that the male gamer is a lonely ‘nerd’ that has no girlfriend and is afraid to talk to women with reasons I do not understand. 

Whether you believe the stereotype or not, this type of attitude towards women is STILL not okay. If you are just a shy person that is awkward just talking to ANYONE, that’s fine! I completely understand why introverts hate everyday socializing; people can just be exhausting…

But it is completely different if you can hold a content conversation with a male yet completely disregard a woman’s voice. If it is because you find women terrifying, then STOP! There is nothing to be afraid of! Whether you are intimidated, frightened, or just plain awkward, this type of behavior can be just as harmful as acting like an angry troll. The sheer disrespect of not speaking to a woman just because you “don’t know how to talk to a female” is still contributing to the misogynistic tendency plaguing the game world.

So TALK TO ME! Ask me how I'm doing, what my interests are; I can promise you we are not that different...

Just don't call me a girl gamer...

Never call anyone a girl gamer.
